# Discord Bio


Change Discord bio easily with a few commands and host it on Heroku for free so it can change every min.

For changing the costume bio and the emojis just paste your text and emojis into the list.

you need to extract your token from the discord itself and put it as the environment variable in Heroku.

Be careful with your discord token because if you share it your data will be stolen and no one will be responsible.
